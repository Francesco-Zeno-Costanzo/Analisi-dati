# Analisi-dati
These codes can be used for data analysis, using numpy and scipy functions; in folder: dati prova, there are txt with experimental data to test the codes in which possible data are not generated by the program.

apri_immagine.py allows you to acquire the coordinates of the pixels of a photo

errori.py is used to propagate errors through the computation of derivatives performed by simpy

fft(sim-real).py calculates the fft of a simulated and a real sine wave signal

fit cerchio.py returns the fit of a circumference (uses the coope method)

fit ellisse.py returns the fit of a ellipse (based on Halir and Flusser article)

fit fourier.py Use Fourier series to fit a function (shark fin wave)

fit generico.py is a code for a generic fit

fit poisson.py fits distributed data according to the poisson distribution

media mobile.py compute the moving average
